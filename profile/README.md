The **DivvunGiellatekno** organisation hosts repositories that are only relevant to the language technology work in Troms√∏, in contrast with work we share with other groups. Our work is organised in the following [GitHub organisations](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations):

- **[DivvunGiellatekno](https://github.com/divvungiellatekno)** - this organisation; stuff only relevant to UiT language technology work
- **[GiellaLT](https://github.com/giellalt)** -language resources and their documentation, shared with international collaborators and language communities
- **[Divvun](https://github.com/divvun)** - language independent technology for which the [Divvun group](https://divvun.no) is responsible
- **[Giellatekno](https://github.com/giellatekno)** - language independent code and projects for which the [Giellatekno group](https://giellatekno.uit.no) is responsible
